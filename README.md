# Customer Data Cleaner & YAML/JSON Config Generator

I built this CLI tool to clean up messy customer data (CSV/Excel), remove duplicates, and create custom YAML/JSON config files. It’s been a fun project playing around with Ruby and different gems to make the process smoother!

## What I’ve Done So Far:
- Cleaned up CSV files, formatted data, and removed duplicates (because messy data is the worst).
- Created a way to map fields manually and generate YAML or JSON configs. It's like magic!

## What’s Next:
- I'm experimenting with other gems to make the tool even better. Stay tuned for more fun updates!

## Usage

- **Clean Data:**  
  `ruby cli.rb clean sample.csv`

- **Map Fields & Generate Config:**  
  `ruby cli.rb map sample.csv`
